File Commands:
--------------
C-x C-f : Opens a file, asks for the file name. If it cannot find the file, creates the file
C-x C-s : Saves the file without a prompt
C-x s   : Saves all files with a prompt  
C-s C-w : Saves the file with a different name. Asks you for the name.

Everytime you save a file, Emacs creates another file with the name "filename~".
This tilde(~) file is the previous version of the file. It will be in the same dir.
Also, Emacs auto-saves everything you type to a file with the name "#filename#".
If you quit Emacs without saving, you can see this auto-save file. Let's do that.
C-x C-c : Quits Emacs.

M-x recover-file: recovers the auto-saved file.

M-w     : Copies this region into the clipboard.
